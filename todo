  feature selection (iterative search)
    univariate feature selection (SelectKBest, chi2)
    recursive feature elimination (RFE)
    sequential feature selection
    select from model
    permutation importance measure variable's importance

  unbalancement
    raising threshold lowers positive labes (FP and TP)
    oversampling (SMOTE)
    roc, auc

  test 7 anni
  MLP, KNN, Gradient boosting (gradient learn) are no subject to unbalanced
  SVC and RF sono soggetti a unbalancement
  lifelines: cox regression p-values per tutte le variabili, usato dai medici per convincerli


done ==========================================================
  visualize PCA, T-SNE: T-SNE shows a subtle division between healthy and sick patients
  undersampling: helps a little to reduce FP
  feature scaling: standardization helps to increase a bit F1-macro
  penalized model: helps to reduce FP!

todo ==========================================================
  Medicine effect on the model's outcome, changing the terapies to assess the effects


done ==========================================================
  visualize the wrong classified data (visualize the worst)
  lifelines library: uni/multivariate cox model is used to find the important predictors

  diagnosis groups: Post-ischemic, AMI, PMI, CABG, PCI, Angina, Aritmie 

  ensemble: improves the best score by 2%

  test 7 years, raising years make the data more balanced: no improvements

  feature selection: improves only rf
    univariate feature selection (SelectKBest, chi2)
    recursive feature elimination (RFE): rf with 36/39 features gains 1.5%
    sequential feature selection (SFS): rf with 20/39 featrues gains 1.4%

  unbalancement
    predicting probs and modifying threshold controls the FP, FN 
    undersampling: helps to reduce FP as penalized models and improves the performances!
    oversampling (SMOTE): helps to improve the performance 
    penalized model: helps to reduce FP!
    use other metrics i.e. f1, auc, balanced accuracy

  visualize PCA, T-SNE: T-SNE shows a subtle division between healthy and sick patients
  feature scaling: standardization helps to increase F1-macro


steps =========================================================
  1. select metric: predict probabilities or labels
    AUC, is positive or negative class more important? PR AUC when positive class is most important
    F2 if false negatives are more costly, F0.5 opposite
  2. check ml algorithms
  3. check unbalanced algorithms
  4. hyperparameter tuning
